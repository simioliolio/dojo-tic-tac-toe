 Nice work getting that test to pass!
 If you like, you can copy over your `display` func and use it in the `description` var within the `Game` struct below.
 
 However, the main thing we need is a `move` function,
 something that transforms a game as per a player's wishes. 
 A game might look a bit like this
 
 ````
 let first = move("O", to: 4, in: Game(starting: "O")
 let second = move("X", to: 0, in: first)
 let third = move("O", to: 6, in: second)
 ````
 
 - Experiment: 
 Write a `move` func that takes the symbol to play, where on the board to play it, and then a `Game` struct. The output of this func is a new, updated `Game`. \
We made a few tests for you but this time they are // mostly commented out
